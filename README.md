# LiveSeries Legacy
LiveSeries Legacy -- an open source TV show management and scheduling system.
You can search for movies and shows, track which episodes you've watched, and subscribe to those which you like best.
The program will automatically download unwatched episodes of subscribed TV shows as they release, as well as unwatched episodes from the past.
You need a bittorrent application to handle the `.torrent` files downloaded by this program, such as [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/).

## IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE
Please ensure that downloading torrents is legal in your country before installing this program.
Refer to the copyright section at the bottom of this page or the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/kguzek/LiveSeriesLegacy/blob/master/LICENSE) included in this repository, specifically §15 and §16.
